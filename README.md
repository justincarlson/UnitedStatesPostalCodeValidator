# UnitedStatesPostalCodeValidator

This is just a quick and dirty validator for US postal codes.  It checks many of the known region assignments and then uses smartystreets to do a lookup if that fails.

Since SmartyStreets provides 250 lookups free and the zone matching catches 90% of the errors this little fella can validate quite a few state and zip code pairs.
